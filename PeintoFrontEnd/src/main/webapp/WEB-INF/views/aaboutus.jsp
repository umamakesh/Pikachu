Various technologies exist for making paints that change color. Thermochromic paints and coatings contain materials that change conformation when heat is applied or removed, and so they change color. Liquid crystals have been used in such paints, such as in the thermometer strips and tapes used in aquaria and novelty/promotional thermal cups and straws. These materials are used to make eyeglasses.

Color-changing paints can also be made by adding halochrome compounds or other organic pigments. One patent[16] cites use of these indicators for wall coating applications for light colored paints. When the paint is wet it is pink in color but upon drying it regains its original white color. As cited in patent, this property of the paint enabled two or more coats to be applied on a wall properly and evenly. The previous coats having dried would be white whereas the new wet coat would be distinctly pink. Ashland Inc. introduced foundry refractory coatings with similar principle in 2005[17][18] for use in foundries.

Electrochromic paints change color in response to an applied electric current. Car manufacturer Nissan has been reportedly working on an electrochromic paint, based on particles of paramagnetic iron oxide. When subjected to an electromagnetic field the paramagnetic particles change spacing, modifying their color and reflective properties. The electromagnetic field would be formed using the conductive metal of the car body.[19] Electrochromic paints can be applied to plastic substrates as well, using a different coating chemistry. The technology involves using special dyes that change conformation when an electric current is applied across the film itself. This new technology has been used to achieve glare protection at the touch of a button in passenger airplane windows.

==Application==
Paint can be applied as a solid, a gaseous suspension ([[aerosol]]) or a liquid. Techniques vary depending on the practical or artistic results desired.

As a '''solid''' (usually used in industrial and automotive applications), the paint is applied as a very fine powder, then baked at high temperature. This melts the powder and causes it to adhere to the surface. The reasons for doing this involve the chemistries of the paint, the surface itself, and perhaps even the chemistry of the substrate (the object being painted). This is called "[[powder coating]]" an object.

As a '''gas''' or as a gaseous suspension, the paint is suspended in solid or liquid form in a gas that is [[spray painting|sprayed on]] an object. The paint sticks to the object. This is called "spray painting" an object. The reasons for doing this include:

* The application mechanism is air and thus no solid object touches the object being painted;
* The distribution of the paint is uniform, so there are no sharp lines;
* It is possible to deliver very small amounts of paint;
* A chemical (typically a [[solvent]]) can be sprayed along with the paint to dissolve together both the delivered paint and the chemicals on the surface of the object being painted;
* Some chemical reactions in paint involve the orientation of the paint [[molecules]].

In the '''liquid''' application, paint can be applied by direct application using [[brush]]es, [[paint rollers]], [[Palette knife|blades]], scrapers, other instruments, or body parts such as fingers and thumbs.

Rollers generally have a handle that allows for different lengths of poles to be attached, allowing painting at different heights. Generally, roller application requires two coats for even color. A roller with a thicker [[nap (textile)|nap]] is used to apply paint on uneven surfaces. Edges are often finished with an angled brush.

*Using the finish flat one would most likely use a 1/2" nap roller
*Using the finish eggshell one would most likely use a 3/8" nap roller
*Using the finish satin or pearl one would most likely use a 3/8" nap roller
*Using the finish semi-gloss or gloss one would most likely use a 3/16" nap roller

{{anchor|Open time}}After liquid paint is applied, there is an interval during which it can be blended with additional painted regions (at the "wet edge") called "open time". The open time of an oil or alkyd-based emulsion paint can be extended by adding [[white spirit]], similar glycols such as Dowanol (propylene glycol ether) or open time prolongers. This can also facilitate the mixing of different wet paint layers for aesthetic effect. Latex and acrylic emulsions require the use of drying retardants suitable for water-based coatings.

Paint application by spray is the most popular method in industry. In this, paint is atomized by the force of compressed air or by the action of high pressure compression of the paint itself, and the paint is turned into small droplets that travel to the article to be painted. Alternate methods are airless spray, hot spray, hot airless spray, and any of these with an electrostatic spray included. There are numerous electrostatic methods available.

Dipping used to be the norm for objects such as filing cabinets, but this has been replaced by high speed air turbine driven bells with electrostatic spray. Car bodies are primed using cathodic elephoretic primer, which is applied by charging the body depositing a layer of primer. The unchanged residue is rinsed off and the primer stoved.

Many paints tend to separate when stored, the heavier components settling to the bottom, and require mixing before use. Some paint outlets have machines for mixing the paint by shaking the can vigorously for a few minutes.

The opacity and the film thickness of paint may be measured using a [[drawdown card]].

Water-based paints tend to be the easiest to clean up after use; the brushes and rollers can be cleaned with soap and water.

Proper disposal of left over paint is a challenge. Sometimes it can be recycled: Old paint may be usable for a primer coat or an intermediate coat, and paints of similar chemistry can be mixed to make a larger amount of a uniform color.

To dispose of paint it can be dried and disposed of in the domestic waste stream, provided that it contains no prohibited substances (see container). Disposal of liquid paint usually requires special handling and should be treated as hazardous waste, and disposed of according to local regulations.<ref>[http://muextension.missouri.edu/xplor/wasteman/wm6001.htm "Safe Use, Storage and Disposal of Paint"]</ref><ref>[http://www.epa.state.oh.us/pic/facts/hhwpaint.html "Storage and Disposal of Paint Facts"]</ref>

*'''[[Primer (paint)|Primer]]''' is a preparatory coating put on materials before applying the paint itself. The primed surface ensures better [[adhesion]] of the paint, thereby increasing the durability of the paint and providing improved protection for the painted surface. Suitable primers also may block and seal stains, or hide a color that is to be painted over.
*'''[[Emulsion]] paints''' are water-based paints in which the paint material is dispersed in a liquid that consists mainly of water. For suitable purposes this has advantages in fast drying, low toxicity, low cost, easier application, and easier cleaning of equipment, among other factors. 
*'''Flat Finish''' paint is generally used on ceilings or walls that are in bad shape. This finish is useful for hiding imperfections in walls and it is economical in effectively covering relatively great areas. However this finish is not easily washable and is subject to staining.
*'''Matte Finish''' is generally similar to flat finish, but such paints commonly offer superior washability and coverage. (See [[Gloss and matte paint]].)
*'''Eggshell Finish''' has some sheen, supposedly like that of the shell on an egg. This finish provides great washability, but is not very effective at hiding imperfections on walls and similar surfaces. Eggshell finish is valued for bathrooms because it is washable and water repellent, so that it tends not to peel in a wet environment.
*'''Pearl (Satin) Finish''' is very durable in terms of washability and resistance to moisture, even in comparison to eggshell finish. It protects walls from dirt, moisture and stains. Accordingly, it is exceptionally valuable for bathrooms, furniture, and kitchens, but it is shinier than eggshell, so it is even more prone to show imperfections.
*'''Semi-Gloss Finish''' typically is used on trim to emphasise detail and elegance, and to show off woodwork, such as on doors and furniture. It provides a shiny surface and provides good protection from moisture and stains on walls. Its gloss does however emphasise imperfections on the walls and similar surfaces. It is popular in schools and factories where washability and durability are the main considerations.<ref>"Paint Finish and Sheen Information; Info on Satin, Eggshell, Matte, and Other Paint Finishes." Professional Painting Contractor. Professional Painters, 2011. Web. 07 Apr. 2012..</ref>
*'''[[Varnish]]''' and '''[[shellac]]''' are in effect paints without pigment; they provide a protective coating without substantially changing the color of the surface, though they can emphasise the colour of the material. 
*'''[[Wood stain]]''' is a type of paint that is formulated to be very "thin", meaning low in viscosity, so that the pigment soaks into a material such as wood rather than remaining in a film on the surface. Stain is mainly dissolved [[pigment]] or [[dye]] plus binder material in solvent. It is designed to add color without providing a surface coating.
*'''[[Lacquer]]''' is a solvent-based paint or varnish that produces an especially hard, durable finish. Usually it is a rapidly drying formulation.
*'''[[Enamel paint]]''' is formulated to give an especially hard, usually glossy, finish. Some enamel paints contain fine glass powder or metal flake instead of the color pigments in standard oil-based paints. Enamel paint sometimes is mixed with varnish or urethane to improve its shine and hardness.
*'''A [[glaze (painting technique)|glaze]]''' is an additive used with paint to slow drying time and increase translucency, as in [[faux painting]] and for some artistic effects.
*'''A [[roof coating]]''' is a fluid that sets as an elastic membrane that can stretch without harm. It provides UV protection to polyurethane foam and is widely used in roof restoration.
*'''[[Fingerpaint]]s''' are formulations suitable for application with the fingers; they are popular for use by children in primary school activities.
*'''[[Ink]]s''' are similar to paints, except that they are typically made using finely ground pigments or dyes, and are not designed to leave a thick film of binder. They are used largely for writing or [[calligraphy]].
*'''[[Anti-graffiti coating]]s''' are used to defeat the marking of surfaces by [[graffiti]] artists or vandals. There are two categories of anti-graffiti coatings: sacrificial and non-bonding: 
:*'''Sacrificial coatings''' are clear coatings that allow the removal of graffiti, usually by washing the surface with high-pressure water that removes the graffiti together with the coating (hence the term "sacrificial"). After removal of the graffiti, the sacrificial coating must be re-applied for continued protection. Such sacrificial protective coatings are most commonly used on natural-looking masonry surfaces, such as statuary and marble walls, and on rougher surfaces that are difficult to clean. 
:*'''Non-bonding coatings''' are clear, high-performance coatings, usually catalyzed [[polyurethanes]], that do not bond strongly to paints used for graffiti. Graffiti on such a surface can be removed with a solvent wash, without damaging either the underlying surface or the protective non-bonding coating. These coatings work best on smooth surfaces, and are especially useful on decorative surfaces such as mosaics or painted murals, which might be expected to suffer harm from high pressure sprays.
*'''[[Anti-climb paint]]''' is a non-drying paint that appears normal but is extremely slippery. It is useful on drainpipes and ledges to deter burglars and vandals from climbing them, and is found in many public places. When a person attempts to climb objects coated with the paint, it rubs off onto the climber, as well as making it hard for them to climb.
*'''[[Anti-fouling paint]]''', or bottom paint, prevents barnacles and other marine organisms from adhering to the [[hull (watercraft)|hulls]] of ships.
*'''[[Insulative paint]]''' or '''insulating paint''', reduces the rate of thermal transfer through a surface it's applied to. One type of formulation is based on the addition of hollow [[microspheres]] to any suitable type of paint.
*'''Anti-slip paint''' contains chemicals or grit to increase the friction of a surface so as to decrease the risk of slipping, particularly in wet conditions.
*'''Road marking paint'''<ref name="road marking paint">{{cite web|title=road marking paint|url=http://wiki.dyroadmark.com/road-marking-paint.html/}}</ref> is specially used to marking and painting road traffic signs and lines, to form a durable coating film on the road surface. It must be fast drying, provide a thick coating, and resist wear and slipping, especially in wet conditions.
*'''[[Luminous paint]]''' or luminescent paint is paint that exhibits luminescence. In other words, it gives off visible light through fluorescence, phosphorescence, or radioluminescence.
